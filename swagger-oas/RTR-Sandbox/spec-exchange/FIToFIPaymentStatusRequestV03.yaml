It is used to request a FIToFIPaymentStatusReport message containing information on the status of a previously sent instruction. Usage The FIToFIPaymentStatusRequest message is exchanged between agents to request status information about instructions previously sent. Its usage will always be governed by a bilateral agreement between the agents. The FIToFIPaymentStatusRequest message can be used to request information about the status (e.g. rejection, acceptance) of a credit transfer instruction, a direct debit instruction, as well as other intra-agent instructions (for example FIToFIPaymentCancellationRequest). The FIToFIPaymentStatusRequest message refers to the original instruction(s) by means of references only or by means of references and a set of elements from the original instruction. The FIToFIPaymentStatusRequest message can be used in domestic and cross-border scenarios.'
