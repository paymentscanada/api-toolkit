This is a sample kotlin based application using OkHttp and Retrofit2 that connects to the Payments Canada API and gets a sandboxed branch. The following happen:
1. Gets a bearer token with the provided consumer key and consumer secret.
2. Fetches a branch from the sandbox branch-sandbox item using the provided bearer token.

This is to be used as a guide only, with no guarantees made, and is NOT production ready code. Certain values, example: (consumer_key, consumer_secret) will need to be replaced. For more information, visit https://developer.payments.ca/getting-started

### Quick Guide to Execute the Application
- Update the Consumer Key and Consumer Secret (extracted from the Sandbox Branch App in Payments Canada Developer Portal) in the src/main/resources application.
- Execute `./gradlew build` to build the application
- Execute the Application by running the command `./gradlew run --args"9_DIGIT_DPRN"` replacing 9_DIGIT_DPRN with a DPRN.
