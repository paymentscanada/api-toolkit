# Payments Canada API Toolkit
The 'API samples' repo contains various code samples, postman collections and swagger/oas for various Payments Canada APIs. 

## Code sample
Code samples are designed to help developers get started by demonstrating how to make API calls using a variety of programming languages. They are leveraging the FIF Branch sandbox API. 

* [code-samples](code-samples/java): Uses Spring Boot and Spring Rest Templates.
* [angular](code-samples/angular): Uses the angular http class to make calls to the sandbox APIs.
* [kotlin](code-samples/kotlin): Uses OkHttp and Retrofit2 to make calls to the sandbox APIs.
* [nodejs](code-samples/nodejs): Sample nodejs based application that connects to the Payments Canada API and gets a sandbox branch.
* [payments-rail-angular](code-samples/payments-rail-angular): This is a sample angular application that connects to the Payments Canada API and retrieves the data from the fictionalized payments rail APIs.
* [postman collection](postman-collection): Intended to be imported by Postman, has sample APIs for FIF and CCIN extracts.
* [swagger-oas](swagger-oas): A collection of swagger/openAPI specifications for APIs available on our developer portal.
